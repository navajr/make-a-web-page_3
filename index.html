      What a web page and how does it work?

    <div class="topic-description">
      <p>A web page is a text document written in language called <span class="bold">HTML</span>, (<span class="italic"> Hypertext Markup 

Language</span>). Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them. This collection of HTML code makeup the WWW also known as the Internet. The Internet is the world largest computer network with a bunch of computers communicating
        using the main protocol of the web called <span class="italic">HTTP</span>.</p>
      <p>When a person goes to the web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a <span class="italic">HTTP request</span> to a <span class="italic">server</span>. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user’s computer
        where a <span class="italic">web browser</span> interprets the page and displays it on the user’s screen.

      Elements and Tags
    </div>
    <div class="topic-description">
      <p>Elements give structure to a HTML document and tells the browser how you want your website to be presented. Generally elements consists of a start tag, some content, and an end tag. All tags have the same format: they begin with a less-than sign
        and end with a greater-than sign >. Generally speaking, there are two kinds of tags - opening tags: opening and closing tags. The only difference between an opening tag and a closing tag is the forward slash "/". You label content by putting it
        between an opening tag and a closing tag.

      Inline vs. Block Element
    </div>
    <div class="topic-description">
      <p> All<em><b> Whitespace</b></em> is entered in a single line. There is a way to have line breaks by using (b) void tags. Another way is by using (p) tag that has contact. Why do we have a way of making two lines? The (br) tag is what we call inline
        while the (p) tag is what we call block. The br tag is just ending a line. The p tag makes an invisible box and has length and width associated with it.

      <p>Two other elements that are important are
        <Span class="bold">span</span> and <span class="bold">div</span>. With these two elements you can attach styles to them to adjust different behaviors of how text styles or how it’s displayed. the big difference between the twois Span is an inline element while div is block

      The tree-like structure of HTML
    </div>
    <div class="topic-description">
      <p>
        The <span class="bold">"tree-like structure"</span> comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes,
        and so on... Here is an example of a "Tree-like Structure"</p>

      Text Editors (for programming)
    </div>
    <div class="topic-description">
      <p> When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.
        When you read an HTML document as <span class="italic">text</span>, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.

      What is CSS
    </div>
    <div class="topic-description">
      <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements. It is important to avoid repetition with CSS a programmer must find similarity and use <span class="italic">abstraction</span> to avoid unnecessary
        repetition of work. </p>
